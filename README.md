#MSemantic: Rich Snippets and Semantic SEO with GoodRelations#

The free [Magento][mage] extension adds rich data-markup to shop pages so that search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing can display richer item previews in the search results ("[Rich Snippets][grs]") with information about prices, availability, delivery options, images*, etc. This typically increases Click-Through-Rates (CTR) by up to 30 %.

At the same time, your shop will be more accessible for browser extensions and mobile applications.
